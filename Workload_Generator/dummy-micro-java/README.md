# dummy-micro 

This provides a Java microservice that can be used to create,
1. Model generic applications as DAGS.
2. Build different data flow patterns ( a. chained b. aggregator c.hybrid).
3. Mimic complex interactions such as shared microservices, candidate microservices.

### Microservice Configuration available at : 
         src/main/resources/application.properties

### Docker Images Available at : 
         https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/samodha/dummy-microservice

### Sample Yaml resource for deployment available at :
         1. For chained pattern (Example APP1)
         2. For aggregator microservice (Example APP2)
         3. For candidate microservice (Example APP3)
         4. Huybrid of all functions (Example APP4)
